            <h2>Why did i even start my journey?</h2>
              <p>Actually this was not my first experience with programming i did try some fun stuff with Arduino and tried building a 3d printed robotic hand</p>
              <p>Also i do feel a sense of accomplishment when i "create" something with code although i myself am still far from calling myself a junior dev</p>

            <h2>So where will my journey go anyway?</h2>
            <p>Well as i am currently starting off i am trying to learn HTML,CSS,Javascript to be able to create some small frontend Projects</p>
            <p>Once i am past this point i am not totally sure if i will enlarge my knowledge to be able to do Backend with Node.Js or i will start integrating python into my learning</p>
            <p>When i get to this point i will think about learning about OOP</p>
