# Personal Landing Page - Vladimir Barablin

## Purpose
This project is my first personal landing page, created to practice and demonstrate basic HTML structure and to publicly document my journey as an aspiring web developer.  
The page serves as an introduction to who I am, why I started learning to code, and where I want to go in the future.

## Features
- Semantic HTML structure using headings, sections, lists, links, and paragraphs
- Personal introduction and learning timeline
- Transparent reflection on learning motivation and goals
- Link to my GitHub profile for portfolio visibility
- Clean and readable HTML, prepared for future CSS styling

## Learning Outcome
While building this page, I practiced:
- Structuring a webpage using semantic HTML elements
- Writing clean and accessible HTML code
- Managing content structure and readability
- Using Git and GitHub to version and publish a project
- Documenting personal progress in a professional way

## Potential Future Improvements
- Add CSS styling to enhance the visual presentation and layout of the page
- Implement responsive design for optimal display across devices
- Continuously update the page to reflect my ongoing learning journey and new skills
- Potential future addition of accessibility enhancements (ARIA roles, landmarks)

## Live View / Demo
Currently hosted on GitHub (static HTML page).
