# Personal Landing Page – Vladimir Barablin

## 📌 Purpose
A personal landing page created as part of my learning journey.  
Currently focused on integrating **basic CSS styling and layout techniques** to make the page visually more engaging and responsive.

## ✨ Features Implemented
- Responsive layout base with `max-width`, `margin: auto`, and `text-align`
- Applied `radial-gradient()` for a dynamic background
- Styled anchor tags (`a:link`, `:visited`, `:hover`, `:active`, `:focus`)
- Accessible color contrasts and basic structural clarity

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
While styling this page, I practiced:
- Using different CSS properties and selectors confidently
- Writing consistent, clean, and structured CSS code
- Applying accessibility-aware styling choices
- Documenting and versioning my work in a reproducible way

## 🚀 Potential Future Improvements
- Further modular styling (reusable class system)
- Introduce layout systems like Flexbox or Grid
- Add ARIA roles and semantic regions to improve accessibility
- Consider adding a dark mode and basic interactivity (JS later)
